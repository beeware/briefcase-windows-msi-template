Briefcase Windows MSI Template
==============================

A template for building Python apps that will run under Windows.

**This repository branch contains a template for Python 3.8**.
Other Python versions are available by cloning other branches of repository.

Using this template
-------------------

The easiest way to use this project is to not use it at all - at least,
not directly. `Briefcase <https://github.com/pybee/briefcase/>`__ is a
tool that uses this template, rolling it out using data extracted from
your ``setup.py``.

However, if you *do* want use this template directly...

1. Install `cookiecutter`_. This is a tool used to bootstrap complex project
   templates::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

2. Run ``cookiecutter`` on the Python-Windows template::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-Windows-msi-template --checkout 3.8

3. `Download the Python Embedded Windows install`_, and extract it.

4. Add your code to the template. At the very minimum, you need to have an
   ``app/<app name>/__main__.py`` file that defines an entry point that
   will start your application. If ``<app name>`` contains a dash, it will be
   converted to an underscore in the expected package name

   If your code has any dependencies, they should be installed under the
   ``app_packages`` directory.


If you've done this correctly, a project with a formal name of ``My Project``,
with an app name of ```my-project`` should have a directory structure that
looks something like::

    My Project/
        My Project.lnk
        app/
            my_project/
                __init__.py
                __main__.py
                app.py
        app_packages/
            ...
        python/
            ...

The top level directory should identify as an Windows application, and can be
distributed as a standalone package.

Next steps
----------

Of course, just running Python code isn't very interesting by itself - you'll
be able to output to the console, and see that output in XCode, but if you
tap the app icon on your phone, you won't see anything - because there isn't a
visible console on an iPhone.

To do something interesting, you'll need to work with the native Windows system
libraries to draw widgets and respond to screen taps. One option is the `toga`_
library, which is a cross-platform widget toolkit that supports Windows.

If you have any external library dependencies (like ``toga``, or anything other
third-party library), you should install the library code into the
``app_packages`` directory. This directory is the same as a  ``site_packages``
directory on a normal Python install.
